# Youth Sports League
My daughter is an avid basketball player and my husband is an avid stats guy. I have spent some time reviewing websites of multiple youth basketball programs and leagues, as well as listened as my husband rattled off statistics about various players. I wanted to experiment on my end with a sports roster app that might improve both the youth player and coach experience and include the option for stats entry and tracking.
