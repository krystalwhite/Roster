# Youth Sports League
My daughter is an avid basketball player and my husband is an avid stats guy. I have spent some time reviewing websites of multiple youth basketball programs and leagues, as well as listened as my husband rattled off statistics about various players. I wanted to see what I can do on my end to improve the youth player and parent experience on these sites and also include the option for stats entry and tracking.
